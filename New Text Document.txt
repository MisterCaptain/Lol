(Hey It's Mc Morgz, this is a song for all the ladies out there, Mmmmha)

[TEXT TO SPEECH]
Mc Morgz is so hot
I want to fuck his
brains out
and let him empty his
ball sack
on my boobess?
--------------------
[McMorgz] - Chorus
All these girls want me bad
(Oh McMorgz just be our man)
This is getting out of hand
It's not my fault how hot I am

Now all these girls want me bad
(Oh McMorgz just be our man)
This is getting out of hand
It's not my fault how hot I am
--------------------------------
[McMorgz] - Verse 1 
When I walk in freckler looking cool
Girls just drop and start to drool
Can't take my eyes off me like its the rules
(Oh McMorgz it's primary school)
I give them a smile, a wink and a wave
They want to buy me a drink and be my slave
All the guys turn around and looked amazed
To me it's just any other day
When they pull me over and start to grind
But I have other things on my mind
So I tell them I don't really have the time
And I head backstage like it's a crime
There's Rebecca, Hando, Proud and Stacy
I can't keep up with all these ladies
It just seems do damn crazy
'Cause all they wanna do is lay me
Obviously there's Becky Manning
I heard our wedding, she's already planning
It's like I'm her genie, who's wishing I'm granting
I guess she finds me so enchanting
Bicky,Becka,Rose,Rosey
Seems like every girl that knows me
Want to get with me and be real cozy
But I just want one girl to blow me
-----------------------------------------------------------
[McMorgz] - Chorus
All these girls want me bad
(Oh McMorgz just be our man)
This is getting out of hand
It's not my fault how hot I am

Now all these girls want me bad
(Oh McMorgz just be our man)
This is getting out of hand
It's not my fault how hot I am
